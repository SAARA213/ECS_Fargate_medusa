## Set Up AWS Credentials

Ensure you have updated AWS credentials. You'll use these to authenticate your Terraform scripts with AWS.
## Create the Terraform Script

ECR (Elastic Container Registry): Create a repository in ECR to store the Docker image of Medusa.
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Define a VPC with appropriate subnets (public/private) and security groups.
ECS Cluster: Provision an ECS Cluster using Fargate as the launch type.
Task Definition: Define the task, specifying the Docker container configuration for Medusa.
ECS Service: Set up an ECS service that will use the task definition and ensure the containers run on Fargate Spot.
Networking Components: Configure necessary components like load balancers, target groups, and listeners to manage traffic to your ECS tasks.
## Build and Push Docker Image

Build the Docker image for Medusa on your local machine or CI/CD pipeline.
Push the image to the ECR repository.
## Deploy Using Terraform

Run the Terraform scripts to provision the infrastructure on AWS.
Terraform will create the ECS cluster, register the task definition, create the ECS service, and handle all the networking.
## Test and Verify

Once deployed, test the Medusa platform by accessing it via the load balancer's DNS or public IP.
Verify that the ECS tasks are running as expected on Fargate Spot instances.
## Monitor and Optimize

Use CloudWatch and other AWS monitoring tools to keep an eye on the deployment.
Ensure that the setup is cost-efficient and making the best use of Fargate Spot capacity.
